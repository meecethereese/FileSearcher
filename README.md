Problem Statement

Your local supermarket "Please Buy?" has gone entirely digital. They maintain logs, receipts, and
everything else on a computer. Despite the IT guyâ€™s best effort, the files and folders are getting
messy and things get lost. Given this problem, the IT guy wrote a program that gets directories of
files and the line number within those files for a certain string token. The IT guy implemented a
functional, but slow, synchronous solution. To boost your ego, you decide to re-write the program in
JavaScript to make it faster via asynchronous programming.

Task

Use your JavaScript knowledge to implement the solution. When given the path to a directory and
target string token, it should return an object with keys as pathname and values as an array of
line numbers in which the string token matches. The solution will leverage asynchronous programming.

Keeping the complexity of directories in mind, provide a solution to this task.
